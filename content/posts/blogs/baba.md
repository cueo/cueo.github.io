# India and Baba Culture

India's obsession with pseudoscience in the name of spirituality is not new. It has been going on for centuries. But in the last few decades, it has become a billion-dollar industry. The sad part is it's not just the uneducated ones who fall into the trap of word salad of these so-called spiritual gurus. Even the educated ones are not immune to this.

Critical thinking needs to be inculcated in the new generation from a young age. It's the only way to fight this pseudoscience and superstition building a better future for our country where the populace is not easily swayed by these crooks.

# BYOB (Be Your Own Baba)
A piece of advice, do not take advice especially when it comes to health and science from these charlatans. In fact, do not take advice from anyone who is not an expert in that field. Even if you come across something that sounds plausible, do your own research. Do not blindly believe what you hear or read. Be your own fact-checker.

In the words of [Capatain Disillusion](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptainDisillusion), "Love with your heart, use your head for everything else."
