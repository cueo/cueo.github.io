# Hello, Friend!

Is this a blog? Maybe. But I would like to think of this as more of a brain dump or a second brain. I would like dump my fleeting thoughts and ideas here. Maybe some code, maybe some prose. It's a way to reference my past self and to keep track of my thoughts. Maybe you will find something of use here but probably you won't.

This is not my first attempt at blogging and quite possibly not my last. I often find myself trying to remember something I thought about in the past but it's often lost in time and space. I hope this blog makes my brain a little more accessible and my lost thoughts a little more discoverable.

Let's see how this one goes. Cheers!
